The main goal was to build a model which can mainly suggest suitable Yoga poses that the user can primarily adopt in his/her daily routine to provide the required set of benefits the user wants. The model must predict the Asanas taking care of user-defined constraints, including benefits, age, contraindication, and Level of Pose.

Datasets from suggested books were collected and implemented pre-processing steps like Tokenization, Stop words removal, and Regular Expressions using the python gensim library. For computers to use language for predictive models and understand words, the words must be translated into numbers. We analyzed the importance of famous word vectorization techniques like One hot encoding, Word2Vec, and TF-IDF to get the word embeddings. At last, Artificial Neural Network was built to meet the project purpose.
